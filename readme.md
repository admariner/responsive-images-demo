In addition to Photoshop and Sketch, he gives instructions on the `cwebp` CLI tool too which is great if you can't those other tools like me. An added benefit is that the CLI tool is actually more flexible in controlling your desired output. More details in the [docs on `cwebp` here](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp).
